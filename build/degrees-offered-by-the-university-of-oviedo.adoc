== Introduction
The University of Oviedo offers many Degrees (like Degree in Law, Degree in History or Degree in Computer Software Engineering), of different branches (Health Sciences, Arts and Humanities...) and located in different places. Sometimes, specially for new students, this can be quite confusing, and some of the questions asked are:

* “Which Degrees can I study in this branch?”

* “Where do I study that?”

* “Is there a mark cut-off?” (Some Degrees require a minimum mark)

* “If I don't get into the Degree I want, what similar alternatives do I have?”

In order to answer these, and many other questions, we have modeled this information in a graph database.
Obviously, this could be even more interesting if the database included all the information of all Degrees in Spain, but for simplicity, we have decided to start only with the Degrees in the University of Oviedo.

== Model
The University of Oviedo offers many _Degrees_ , which belong to different _branches_. Also, these Degrees are taught at a _Faculty_, _School_, or _Partner Institution_. Both Schools and Faculties are public centers and belong to the University (which is also public), but Partner Institutions are private centers that have signed an agreement with the University to offer common courses.

In addition, these Schools, Faculties and Partner Institutions are located in a _Campus_.

As an example, here's a little extract of our database.

As you can see, we have three _Degrees_.

* _Degree in Mechanical Engineering_: it has 240 credits, it got 260 new students in 2013 and offers the possibility of getting a bilingual degree. Also, it's taught at the _Polytechnic School of Engineering of Gijón_, founded in 1888. It belongs to the branch of _Engineering and Architecture_.
* _Degree in Social Work_: it also has 240 credits and got 54 new students in 2013. It's taught at the _Faculty of Commerce, Tourism and Social Sciences Jovellanos_, founded in 1899. It belongs to the branch of _Social and Legal Sciences_.
* _Degree in Nursing (Cabueñes)_: as the others, has 240 credits. In the year 2013, 70 places were offered, and 886 students applied to study this degree, but only 70 got in. This degree has a mark cut-off of 10.476, being 14 the maximum possible mark. It's taught at the Partner Institution called _University School of Nursing Cabueñes Gijon_. It belongs to the branch of _Health Sciences_.

The _School, Faculty and Partner Institution_ named above are all located at the _Gijón_ Campus, at the city of Gijón.

Confusing? Take a look to the whole model.
