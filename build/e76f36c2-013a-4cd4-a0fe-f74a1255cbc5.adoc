== Welcome to an Introduction to Graph Data Science

The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library contains a set of graph algorithms exposed through Cypher procedures.
Graph algorithms provide insights into the graph structure and elements, for example, by computing centrality and similarity scores and detecting communities.

This guide follows the ordinary workflow for running the product tier algorithms: PageRank, Label Propagation, Louvain, and Betweenness Centrality. We will cover the following concepts:

* Create a graph and import the data.
* Configure the algorithm to suit your needs and the data.
