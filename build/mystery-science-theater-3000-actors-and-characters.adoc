= Mystery Science Theater 3000 Actors and Characters - GraphGist for the Neo4j GraphGist challenge =

This Graph is based on the MST3K TV-series that ran during the 1990s. Awesome TV-serie, my favourite actually. I created this Graph based on the characters of the show and where they live/reside/hunt, and which actors played them. As the Actors usually played several characters, and many characters were played by several actors, the graph get's a bit interesting :)
Enjoy!
