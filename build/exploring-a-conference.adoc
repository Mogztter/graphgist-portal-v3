// Provide an introduction to your data modeling domain and what you are trying to accomplish
Going to a Conference can be a lot of fun, an important networking opportunity, and a great learning experience. But it can also be hard to choose which workshops to attend. Conference workbooks can help you choose by providing long descriptions of the presentations offered and the biographies of the presenters. But they also can only provide one linear way to look at your options: by date & time.  Neo4j and Graph Databases allow you to easily explore the conference by different category types, presenters, companies, vendors, room numbers, and more.

In our example, we will input data from a specific conference: The Annual MOSES Organic Gardening Conference from 2015. This is the largest event in the U.S. about organic & sustainable farming. It has 160 presenters, 281 companies, and 135 workshops & presentations. These were spread out over the course of 3 days, with 16 rooms, and 45 sessions.

== Attend Your Favorite Presentation Category

Suppose you are crazy about Livestock. Perhaps you make your living with Livestock. Here is how we can make sure we are aware of try to attend all the Presentations with a Category Type of "Livestock".

//Return all Livestock category Presentations (TABLE)

== Attend Your Favorite Author/Presenter/Friend

Imagine sitting through your first session at a Conference, and the speaker is so good, you want to make sure you attend *all* of their workshops and sessions. That is, if they're even doing more than one! You frantically skim through the conference workbook, trying to read the speakers' names listed at the bottom of every Presentation description. A tedious and error prone process.
Here is a simple query in Neo4j:

//Return all Presentations by Favorite Presenter
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (pr:Presentation)-[:Presented_By]->(p:Person {name:'John Jeavons'}),
      (pr)-[:Is_In_Session]->(s:Session),
      (pr)-[:Is_In_Room]->(r:Room)
RETURN p.name as PersonName, pr.name as PresentationName, s.Name as Session, r.Name as Room
----

//table

== Which Speakers Never Shut Up?

Just kidding! (I hear the secret is to wear comfortable shoes!) +
Which speakers at the conference have to stand up the most because they are giving the most *Presentations*? Are they Conference Royalty, or are these the thought leaders in your industry? You have decided to review their *Presentations* for your schedule.

This query returns *Persons* that are giving 3 or more *Presentations* at the Conference. We will also return the *Company* Name they work for, and concatenate the names if they work for multiple Companies.
//Return Presenters and their Presentation Count in order
[source,cypher]
----
//Which presenters have the most presentations (TABLE)
MATCH (pr:Presentation)-[:Presented_By]->(p:Person)
WITH p, COUNT(*) as Count
WHERE Count > 2
MATCH (p)-[Works_For]->(c:Company)
WITH p, COLLECT(c) as Companies, Count
RETURN p.name as Name, Extract(c in Companies | c.name) as `Company Names`, Count
ORDER BY Count Desc
----

//table

//Return Presenters with most Presentations (GRAPH)

----
MATCH (:Presentation)-[:Presented_By]->(p:Person)

== I didn't know my neighbor was here!
There's nothing quite like traveling hundreds of miles just to meet someone you live in the same town with! Suddenly your industry or niche isn't as small as you thought it was. Discovering vendors, companies, and presenters from your neck of the woods can create a wonderful, future opportunity for both you.

//Return some Company-City Counts
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Company)
WITH c.city as NCity, c.state as NState, COUNT(*) AS Count
RETURN 
   CASE NCity
     WHEN "" THEN "No City Listed"
     ELSE NCity

   CASE NState
      WHEN "" THEN "No State Listed"

== Conclusion

Graph Databases allow for unique opportunities to view your data. +

Future work for this "Exploring A Conference" dataset will include breaking out City/State data into their own Nodes. This will allow more interesting traversal in the graph, and would allow for adding a good insertion point to connect outside data to. For instance, Longitude & Latitude values would allow for distance caculations against the user (How far away is this vendor from me?), or against conference location (Who traveled the farthest?)

Categories could be applied to *Companies*, which could allow users to filter for their specific needs or interests. Did they also have a booth at the conference? Then you could target your booth visits.
