= Homework Assignement: Create a small Graph Use Case Model with Neo4j and Cypher

== Domain and Data

Take a domain that you are really interested in, be it politics, beer, music, arts, cooking, sports, travel, software, organizations.

Draw a model of the domain on a whiteboard or digitally, add a few example entities (nodes) you know and their relationships.
Think about at least 3 questions you want to answer using this _connected_ data.
Remember to add all the information you need to answer those questions.

You should end up with *at least 15 nodes and 20 relationships*.

== GraphGist Format

Now go to http://portal.graphgist.org/about and learn about the GraphGist documentation format (which is basically AsciiDoc a text-markup language with a few embellishments).

You can either start from the template that is provided there or a blank plain text file.

You can also explore the other GraphGists on the portal for further inspiration.

== Setup

Add a snappy *title* for your demo and *some prose* that describes the domain and the types of its entities and their relationships.

Now *add an image* link, e.g. to the drawing you created earlier.

Now you can start creating your domain with Cypher, Neo4j's query language in a *Setup* section.
Follow the syntax example in the template or on the portal page.

//setup
//hide
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (john:Person {name:"John"})
CREATE (ann:Person {name:"Ann"})
CREATE (john)-[:KNOWS]->(ann)
CREATE (john)<-[:KNOWS]-(:Person {name:"Fred"})
----

//graph

Render the resulting graph with the *`//graph`* marker.

== Show all friends of John

Then take your questions from before and put each of them in a titled section (e.g. `== Show all friends of John`) add some prose.

Add the Cypher statement in a `[source,cypher]` codeblock.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (me:Person {name:"John"})-[:KNOWS]-(friend)
RETURN friend, me.name
----

//graph_result

//table

Render the results either as `//table` *or* `//graph_result`.

== Submission & Grading

While you're working and when you are done, you can use the "Preview" functionality of the GraphGist portal to render your document in your browser.
Go to http://portal.graphgist.org/submit_graphgist add the public URL of your file, your title and click `Preview`.

When done, either hand in the preview link or submit your link to the portal and share the resulting link with your lecturer.


*The grading will be on completeness, correct usage of Cypher, good prose and educational quality of your queries (i.e. at least 2 of the 3 should use relationships or paths).*
